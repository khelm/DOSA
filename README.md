DOSA (Discovery Of SPARC data Application)

DOSA is an application that allows the user to find data on the
Blackfynn data platform.  The user can select a file 
containing a set of terms that are either user-generated or from
the SPARC terminology and the application
will query SPARC-related projects on the Blackfynn platform for
similar models.  The percentage overlap between the terms and
the models of relevant datasets will be returned. The code create_model 
read in terms from a file that constitutes a model and will create 
that model with the properties and relationships taken from the 
contents of the terms in the file.  The format of the file is: 
relationships,...,classes,... where each term in the given category is 
on a new line.

Project was built during the 2018 SPARC Hackathon in Bethesda, MD.
