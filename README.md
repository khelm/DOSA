DOSA (Discovery Of SPARC data Application)

DOSA is an application that allows the user to find data on the
Blackfynn data platform.  The user can select a data file or 
directory containing an experiment model file and the application
will query SPARC-related projects on the Blackfynn platform for
similar projects.  Results will be returned on the basis of 
similarity of models or the data file headers.

Project was built during the 2018 SPARC Hackathon in Bethesda, MD.
